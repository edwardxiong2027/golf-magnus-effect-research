# The Magnus Effect in Golf: Quantifying Spin-Induced Trajectory Deviations

## Research Overview

This research project investigates the **Magnus effect** in golf ball flight—the phenomenon where a spinning ball curves due to pressure differentials created by spin-air interaction. We develop computational models to predict trajectory deviations and validate predictions using PGA Tour launch monitor data.

## Research Question

**How accurately can a physics-based Magnus effect model predict golf ball trajectory deviations based on spin rate, spin axis, and launch conditions?**

## Key Features

- **Theoretical Framework:** Derivation of Magnus force equations for golf balls
- **Computational Modeling:** Numerical simulation of 3D golf ball trajectories
- **Data Analysis:** Statistical comparison with professional golf data
- **Practical Applications:** Insights for shot shaping and club fitting
